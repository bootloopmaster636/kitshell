## State of this project

This project is currently in maintenance state, stable enough to daily drive.
However, no major feature will be added yet.

I have a plan in coming month to rewrite this from scratch (maybe with more planning),
because the current implementation is just a proof of concept of what can be done with Flutter.

The rework will have more features and less bugs. I **will** rewrite this, as soon as I finish my internship (around
late January 2025),
because I don't have much of free time right now.

Thanks to all who contributed, download, and/or use this project.  
Best regards,
